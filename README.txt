⭐ The majority of highly-rated restaurants are situated in San Luis Potosi, drawing visitors from other areas. There is an opportunity to enhance our food and service offerings in other cities as well.
⭐ Mexican cuisine is the most preferred choice and American cuisine ranks as the second most popular choice among customers, yet the number of restaurants offering this cuisine is limited. There is potential to expand our presence in this market segment.
⭐ It is noted that students and teenagers tend to have a preference for beverages and smoking. To capture this demographic, It is advisable to target marketing strategies, such as offering special entry or discount for students.
